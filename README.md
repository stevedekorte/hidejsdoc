# Hide JSDoc

## About

A tiny extension that auto folds all JSDocs when a file is opened.
This helps to reduce visual clutter and focus on the code.
You can unfold the jsdocs to view them.

## How to install this extension:

1. Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view.
2. Drag the .vsix file from this repository into the Extensions view.

## Notes

### Publishing

I'd like to publish this to the marketplace, but I ran into issues with Azure and don't have time to look into it further right now.

### Development

I had the idea for this extension but used Cursor.app (with Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to write and debug the code. I didn't even look at code, so I can't vouch for it. _Use at your own risk_.

### Support

If you have an issue, please open the source in Cursor (or a similar IDE) and ask it to fix it. That's all I would do anyways.

### Contributing

If you make an improvement you'd like to share, feel free to make a pull request.
